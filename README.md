RULE: Only add filters when the NLP clearly mentions a specific value.
If NLP mentions something like “account X”, “customer 123”, “age > 40”, “payments above 5000”, then include the correct WHERE or pattern filter.
If NLP does NOT mention any specific value, do NOT add a filter.
Never skip a filter when the NLP includes one.
Never create a filter when the NLP doesn’t say one.
