The previous GSQL you generated for this NLP failed with a TigerGraph syntax/semantic error.
Your job is to FIX that exact GSQL and return a syntactically valid TigerGraph GSQL query.

VERY IMPORTANT – FIX ONLY, DO NOT REWRITE FROM SCRATCH:

- Treat PREVIOUS INVALID GSQL as the base.
- Make the SMALLEST possible edits needed to fix syntax and rule violations.
- Do NOT change the high-level logic or traversal unless the error message forces you to.
- Do NOT reinterpret the natural-language request.
- Do NOT introduce new vertex/edge/attribute names that were not used before, unless required by schema rules.
- Preserve accumulator intent; only move ACCUM/POST-ACCUM to legal positions and fix names/casing.
